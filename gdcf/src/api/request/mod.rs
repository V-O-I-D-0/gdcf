//! Module containing structs modelling the requests processable by the
//! Geometry Dash servers
//!
//! Each struct in this module is modelled strictly after the requests made by
//! the official Geometry Dash client.
//!
//! It further does not attempt to provide any (de)serialization for the
//! request types, as there are simply no sensible defaults. When providing
//! (de)serialization for requests, take a look at solutions like serde's
//! remote types.
